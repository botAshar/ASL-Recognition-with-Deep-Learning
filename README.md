#ASL-Recognition-with-Deep-Learning#
In this project the images from american languages are recognized using a deep convolution neural network using Tesorflow Keras module. The following tasks are performed:

*Importing the Data
*Examining & Visualizing the Training Data
*One-hot Encoding the Data
*Defining the Keras Module consisting of 6 layers
*Training and Testing the module, Using Categorical Crossentropy as loss function
*Visualizing the Mistakes.
